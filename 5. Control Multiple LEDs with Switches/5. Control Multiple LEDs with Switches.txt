Code :
// Goal: Demonstrate sending and receiving data via serial communication
// Stop output when '0' is received, and resume when '1' is received.

bool stopOutput = false; // Tracks if the output should stop

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); // Start serial communication
  Serial.println("Send '0' to stop or '1' to resume output."); // Instruction
}

void loop() {
  // Check if there's data from the Serial Monitor
  if (Serial.available() > 0) {
    char receivedChar = Serial.read(); // Read the incoming character

    // Check for '0' or '1' to control output

Hardware Components
Arduino Uno (or any Arduino Board):

Used to establish the serial communication.
Its onboard USB interface is used for data transfer.
USB Cable:

Connects the Arduino to the PC for power and data transmission.
PC with Arduino IDE:

Provides the Serial Monitor to send and view the data.
Pin Connections
Arduino USB Port:

No additional wiring is needed for serial communication since the USB cable handles data transfer.
Onboard LEDs (Optional):

The onboard LED connected to pin 13 can be used for visual feedback if modified for blinking.
Code
cpp
Copy code
// Goal: Demonstrate sending and receiving data via serial communication.

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600); // Initialize serial communication at 9600 baud rate
  Serial.println("Serial Communication Initialized!"); // Display a welcome message
}

void loop() {
  // Check if data is available to read from the Serial Monitor
  if (Serial.available() > 0) {
    char receivedChar = Serial.read(); // Read the incoming character
    Serial.print("You sent: "); // Acknowledge received character
    Serial.println(receivedChar); // Echo it back to the Serial Monitor
  }

  // Sending data to the Serial Monitor
  Serial.println("Hello from Arduino!");
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second before sending the next message
}
How It Works
Setup:

The Serial.begin(9600) function initializes serial communication at 9600 baud, which must match the Serial Monitor settings.
A message, "Serial Communication Initialized!", is displayed on the Serial Monitor.
Receiving Data:

The Serial.available() function checks if data is available to read from the Serial Monitor.
If data is received, the Serial.read() function captures it, and the Arduino echoes it back with the message "You sent: [character]".
Sending Data:

The Arduino sends "Hello from Arduino!" to the Serial Monitor every second using Serial.println().
Steps to Test
Connect the Arduino:

Use the USB cable to connect the Arduino board to your PC.
Open Arduino IDE:

Load the code into the IDE and upload it to the Arduino.
Open Serial Monitor:

In the Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Serial Monitor. Set the baud rate to 9600.
Test Input/Output:

Observe the "Hello from Arduino!" messages on the Serial Monitor.
Type a character or message in the input field of the Serial Monitor and press send.
The Arduino will echo the received input with "You sent: [character]".
Optional Enhancements
Add a Button:
Use a push button to stop or resume the message transmission. Modify the code accordingly.

Add LEDs:
Blink the onboard LED when data is received for visual feedback.

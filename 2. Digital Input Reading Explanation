Pushbutton with 4 Terminals: Working Principle and Arduino Project

Working Principle of a 4-Terminal Pushbutton
Terminal Connections:

A 4-terminal pushbutton typically has two pairs of internally connected terminals:
1A and 1B are internally connected.
2A and 2B are internally connected.
These pairs are normally open (not connected) when the button is not pressed.


When the Button is Not Pressed:
1A-1B are connected internally but isolated from 2A-2B.
No current flows between the two pairs.

When the Button is Pressed:
1A-1B and 2A-2B are electrically connected.
This completes a circuit between the two pairs.

Why Four Terminals?
Provides flexibility to connect the button in different circuit configurations.
Often used in circuits requiring multiple input/output connections.
How to Use the 4-Terminal Pushbutton with Arduino

Connections:
Pushbutton:
Connect 1A → GND (Ground).
Connect 2A → Pin 2 (Digital Input Pin on Arduino).
LED:
Connect the positive leg (longer leg) of the LED to Pin 13.
Connect the negative leg (shorter leg) of the LED to GND via a 220Ω resistor.
Arduino Code
This code turns on the LED when the button is pressed.

Explanation
Button Configuration:
When the button is not pressed, Pin 2 reads HIGH due to the internal pull-up resistor.
When the button is pressed, it connects Pin 2 to GND, making the pin state LOW.

LED Behavior:
LED turns ON when the button is pressed (buttonState == LOW).
LED turns OFF when the button is not pressed.
Testing the Pushbutton

To verify the pushbutton's functionality:
Use a multimeter in continuity mode.

Test:
Between 1A and 1B → Should always show continuity.
Between 2A and 2B → Should always show continuity.
Between 1A/1B and 2A/2B:
No continuity when the button is not pressed.
Continuity when the button is pressed.
Circuit Diagram Overview

Pushbutton Wiring:
1A → GND
2A → Pin 2 (Arduino)

LED Wiring:
Positive Leg (longer) → Pin 13
Negative Leg (shorter) → Resistor → GND

Troubleshooting
Button State Always HIGH:
Ensure correct connection to 1A → GND and 2A → Pin 2.
Verify that INPUT_PULLUP is used in the code.

LED Not Lighting Up:
Check the LED polarity: the longer leg should connect to Pin 13.

Button State Always LOW:
Verify connections using a multimeter.
Ensure no loose wires or faulty button.
